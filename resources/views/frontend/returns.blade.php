                    <strong>What is Covered?</strong> This warranty covers any defects in material and craftsmanship of the hardware. This warranty applies only to the original consumer purchaser and is non-transferrable. There are no warranties, express or implied, which extend beyond the description on the face hereof, including the implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How Long Does the Coverage Last?</strong> This warranty lasts for the lifetime of the original consumer purchaser as long as you own your Custom Door and Mirror product. Coverage terminates if you sell or otherwise transfer your Custom Door and Mirror product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Will Custom Door and Mirror Do?</strong> Any Custom Door and Mirror Product hardware covered by this warranty which, upon inspection by an authorized representative of CDM , are found by said representative to be defective, at Custom Door and Mirror’s option, Custom Door and Mirror will repair or replace the defective product, or repay the purchase price of the defective product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Does This Warranty Not Cover?</strong> This warranty is applicable only when the products covered by it have been installed in accordance with the recommended written installation instructions of CDM and with established building practices, have been accorded treatment which is considered good practice in the building industry regarding storage and maintenance, and have been subjected only to normal use. Instances that involve improper installation, accident, natural disaster, corrosive air, outdoor use, or product that has been altered will not be covered. Because CDM cannot control the manner in which its products are handled after leaving its premises, this warranty does not apply to the finish or other damage occurring during shipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty bestows certain legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
